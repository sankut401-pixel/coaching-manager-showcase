Project: Coaching Manager (Flutter + Django)

I built an offline-first coaching institute management app with a hosted backend:
- Students: profiles, batches/classes, insights
- Attendance: daily marking + risk list
- Fees: pending tracking + payment entry UX + reminders
- Tests: create tests, enter marks, performance trends
- Reports: CSV/TXT exports + advanced summaries
- Sync: SQLite on-device + push/pull sync to Django API (JWT + Postgres)

Tech: Flutter (Provider, sqflite), Django REST Framework, JWT, PostgreSQL, Render.
